# AIStudyhelp

## Overview

AIStudyhelp is an innovative AI-driven tool designed to help users deepen their understanding of various study topics. This project leverages artificial intelligence to engage users in a dynamic learning process where the AI assists in refining their knowledge by asking relevant questions based on the user's responses.

Through interaction, the AI enhances comprehension by asking questions tailored to the user's understanding level, ensuring a more effective and personalized learning experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Learning**: The AI adjusts its questions based on the user's input, promoting an interactive learning experience.
